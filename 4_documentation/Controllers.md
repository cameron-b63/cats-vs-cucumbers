# Controllers
Controllers are a generalization of functionality across different levels.

## Enemy Controllers
Enemy controllers allow for decoupling of enemy spawning from any particular level. They are used to manage enemy spawning.

## PowerUp Controller
The PowerUp Controller is used to manage powerups across each level; both spawning and their effects.

## NextLevel Controller
The NextLevel Controller is an abstraction which generalizes the functionality of hitting the scratching post taking the player to the next level.
